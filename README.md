this is a website that talks about gaming topics like gaming products, esports, news and of course GAMES.
there will be different game versions for each console. This will be better covered in the website.

Pages
Home  - this will contain the stuff that i want the user to focus. The content in this page will be a mix of the other pages so that i can link to them with a button.

Shop  - this will be the place where users can actually see the games and other products with a price and reccomendation on where to buy it. When the user clicks on one of these games they will be redirected on amazon to actually buy it. I'm thinking of changing the name of this page to 'Best Buy' so that the user can have better/different expectations on the content and purpose of that page.

Categories  - this page will contain many different type of games like FPS, sport games, open worlds etc. There will also be a 'suggested for you' category that will be a mix of trending and popular games.

Esports  - this page will be about professional level gaming, tournaments and their team for each game.

News - this page will contain news about games, ratings, gaming products and their pricings.
